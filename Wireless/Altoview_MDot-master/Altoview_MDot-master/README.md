# About:  `Altoview_MDot`
Contains a library (with example scripts) to send user data to the Altoview Platform using [Multitech mDot](http://www.multitech.com/brands/multiconnect-mdot) with [AT commands](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Cellular%20Modules/AT_Commands_Reference_Guide_r0.pdf) on serial. The library makes use of AT commands (beginning with an `AT` such as `AT+NI` or `AT+NK`).

## Update History 
- v0.2.6
	- The last 5 minor updates have included some cleaning up and additions including:
		- new example script which reads motion from a PIR sensor and sends the count and the pulse length accumumlation to Altoview (psuedo activity monitor).
- v0.2.1
	- *[Hotfix]* This fix was applied to separate the commands list from the ID lists. This should not affect the end user.
	- The `README.md` file was updated with the latest changes.
- v0.2
	- We have changed the software serial ([AltSoftSerial](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_AltSoftSerial.html)) to run the MDot radio while the hardware serial can now be used for printing the debug information.
	- The change above enables the use of serial monitor in the Arduino IDE. This means the XBee module does not need to be disconnected while user is programming the Arduino. 
	- We are using `AltSoftSerial` instead of the traditional SoftwareSerial library because of its advantages such as supporting full-duplex and lower CPU burden.
	-  **Please note** that this version of the library is not backward-compatible with the previous releases.
-  v0.1
	- The library enables you to transmit the information in the correct JSON packets to the Altoview platform.
	- This is the initial release of the library and plenty of hotfixes are under development at this point in time.

## Note well 
- The MDot serial port Baud Rate (BR) should match the BR specified in the `begin(<baud-rate>)` method. To change the BR on the MDot module you need to issue the following commands when you are connected to the module using the debugging tool provided by Multitech (you can also use a serial connection that you have hacked up on the bench with 4 wires; contact us on [Altoview Gitter](https://gitter.im/Altoview/) for help): 
  1. `AT+IPR 38400` to change the BR to `38400` in this example.
  2. `AT&W` to save the changes.
- This library **only** supports boards with an **AVR processor**.
	- Sam processors are on our TODO list 

## How to use
- Install our library using this [Arduino guide under ***Importing a .zip Library***](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc4)
	- This will copy the library folder (AltoviewMDot) to your Arduino IDE directory (eg: `C:\Users\{user}\Documents\Arduino\libraries`). 
	- You will also need to install the **prerequisite** libraries such as [AltSoftSerial](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_AltSoftSerial.html). 
- Create a new Arduino script or alternatively you could use one of the examples provided with the library which could be accessed from this path (eg: `C:\Users\{user}\Documents\Arduino\libraries`).
- Include the library in your new Arduino script: `#include <AltoviewMDot.h>`
- Before the `setup()` instruction, instantiate the mDot object: `AltoviewMDot mdot;` (see [object oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) wiki page for more information
- In the `setup()` function, initialise the mdot object by typing `mdot.begin();` 
- Now you can use the created instance's methods such as `mdot.join()` and `mdot.sendPairs()`, etc. 
  1. `mdot.join()` joins the LoRa network and returns a response code. If the response code is *not equal* to 0 then the join has not been successful and you will need to run the `mdot.join()` command again (consider using a loop). 
  2. Once the `mdot.join()` method is successful, the `mdot.networkSessionKey` method will return the relevant session key


### Wiring and debugging 
- Once you have uploaded the code to your dev board, you must remove the TX and RX wires (otherwise this will disrupt the mdot signals being sent to the LoRa network and you node will not connect) 
	- **NB:** this is only if you are using the mDot on the `Hardware Serial`
- Ensure that all your baudrates match. Everything must **send on** and **receive on** on 38400 (or the baudrate in the `begin()` statement)
- The mDot must be programmed with the **Australian MDot Firmware**. You can find the firmware from `mdot_firmware` folder in our library.
- The baudrate is affected by the speed of the On Board Crystal. If the microcontroller is programmed at 8 Mhz then the dev board performing the serial listening task for the debug serial must also have 8 Mhz 


The mdot object will post data to the serial on its own accord. An explanation of some likely debug responses is listed below: 
```
LaT:sp: {"L":66}            --> sp stands for *send pairs* 
LaT:sc: AT+TXDR?            --> sc stands for *send command* and TXDR stands for transmit data rate (the ? is asking for a response) 
LaT:sc: AT+SEND 11{"L":66}  --> the pairs of data is sent 
```
For more information on AT commands, please see the Multech [AT Command Getting Started Guide](http://www.multitech.net/developer/software/mdot-software/at-command-firmware-user-guide/) and the [DOT Series AT Command Reference Guide](http://www.multitech.com/documents/publications/manuals/s000643.pdf).

### Explanation of some of common methods 

#### `join( )`
This method sends a join request to the LoRa server.

#### `sendPairs( )`
This method accepts a comma separated key-value pair in the form of a `String` or `array of chars`
- example:
`Temp1:26.00,Temp2:22.70,RH%:59,Moral%:100`

## Register your Node in AltoView
- Once you have identified the LoRa node has successfully connected to the LoRa network and is sending data, navigate to [AltoView](http://www.altoview.com/) (create a login if you don't already have one) 
- On the left hand side menu, select **My Nodes** and click **Register a Node** 
- Enter the DevEUI ([Development Extended Unique Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address)) which can be found on the mDot node in small print (look for a 16 value long ID with numbers and letters in it, eg: 00 80 00 00 00 00 AA 66) 
	- The DevEUI should be written in lowercase and **without** any *spaces* or *colons*

#### NB when registering node in AltoView 
- Once the node details have been entered and you have hit the `register` button, the node will have either an `online` or `offline` status. Please note that this status **does not** mean that the node is powered on and connected to the LoRa network. Instead: 
  - `online` --> the node was connected and sending data in the past. In other words, there is a history of the node having sent data
  - `offline` --> the node has never sent data. In other words, AltoView has never seen this nodes DevEUI before 


## Contributions 
After using our library with the given example, you may find yourself wanting to contribute to our project. Or maybe youâ€™d like to use our example as the starting point for your own. To do so, all you need to know is summed up in this [4 minute read from GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

### Gitter 
We have also created the [Altoview Gitter](https://gitter.im/Altoview/) page so you could join-in, listen and/or contribute to the conversations going on about this library and also about Altoview in general. No invitations are required and Gitter accounts are free to create.

### Slack
Our Slack page called ***Lora-Fora*** proceeds the Altoview Gitter and there has been plenty of content and discussions prior to creation of the Altoview Gitter. If you're a big Slack fan or even want to have a peak on what happened so far and want to be in the loop in both fronts feel free to drop us an email and we will invite you to LoRa Fora. There has been plenty of discussion about LoRa, LoRaWAN and other interesting projects leading to creation of Altoview.
